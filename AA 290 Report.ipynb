    "In this report, I will present the implementation of the MCTS-based adaptive stress testing (AST) method presented in [1] on the AutomotiveDrivingModels (ADM) simulator developed in https://github.com/sisl/AutomotiveDrivingModels.jl. The goal of this implementation is to test the models in the simulator by finding the cases where they fail, through exploiting any stochasticity in the environment. This can be done by putting the systems under test in a totally random environment, like in the random walker scenario shown in section 4. However, it is not of interest to explore these situations, as they do not offer any insight into real world cases. For that reason, other more deterministic models have been used with some perturbations. Another thing to note is that it is also not of interest to find cases where the system under test is not at fault, as they do not offer any insight on how to amend the system to avoid such situations. For that case, the last crosswalk scenario is explored. That being said, some of these scenarios are presented to demonstrate the ability of AST to find failure cases for ADM models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "The main part of this implementation is to interface AST with ADM to find cases where vehicles engage in collisions or be in a near collision situation, either with each other or with a pedestrian. The AST method is interfaced with the simulator in the form of the following functions:\n",
    "* **Initialize**: This function sets the simulator to its initial state.\n",
    "* **Update**: This function updates the state of the simulator, by stepping it one time step. It returns the likelihood of the new state, whether the new state is an event, and the minimum distance between the vehicles.\n",
    "* **IsTerminal**: This function returns whether an event happened or if the horizon has been reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward model used in the applied AST is as follows:\n",
    "$$R(s_t,s_{t+1}) = \\left\\{\n",
    "        \\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "            0 & \\quad s_t \\in E, \\\\\n",
    "            min_o(dist(p_e,p_o)) & \\quad s_t \\notin E, t\\geq T \\\\\n",
    "            log P(s_{t+1}\\mid s_t)   & \\quad s_t \\notin E, t\\lt T\n",
    "        \\end{array}\n",
    "    \\right.$$\n",
    "where $E$ is the event state, $T$ is the horizon, $p_e$ is the test vehicle's position, and $p_o$ is the position of any other vehicle in the environment. This reward model enables the AST method to get closer to situations where a collision occures, since the distance between vehicles decrease monotonically until they collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method has been applied to four scenarios, the first is a highway scenario, and the other three are crosswalk scenarios. I will explain in each section how each scenario is built, modeled, and what are the resulting behaviors."

    "This scenario contains three vehicles, one of them is the system under test. The three vehicles are modeled as follows:\n",
    "* Test vehicle: \n",
    "    * **Longitudinal model**: *IntelligentDriverModel*, this model reads the distances to the cars ahead in the lane and their speed, and tries to match the test car's longitudinal acceleration with the other car's speed.\n",
    "    * **Lateral model**: *ProportionalLaneTracker*, uses a PD controller to keep the vehicle in the lane.\n",
    "    * **Lane changing model**: *TimLaneChanger*, reads the distances to other cars along the lane, if they are slow, it reads the distances along other lanes, and switches if there is an available space.\n",
    "* Dummy vehicles:\n",
    "    * **Longitudinal model**: *IntelligentDriverModel*, same as above, but the resulting acceleration is not deterministic, and is perturbed by a gaussian noise: $a_{lon} \\sim N(a_{lon},\\sigma)$.\n",
    "    * **Lateral model**: *ProportionalLaneTracker*, same as above, but the lateral acceleration is perturbed by gaussian noise: $a_{lat} \\sim N(a_{lat},\\sigma)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCTS would exploit these perturbations in the dummy vehicles in order to find the edge case where a collision between the test vehicle and one of the dummy vehicles would occur. The expected outcome of this scenario is that a collision will occur, but it will only be the fault of the other vehicles, since the test vehicle's system is deterministic and will never break its rules.. The following figure shows the initial set up of the scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"highway.png\">\n",
    "**Figure 1**: The test vehicle shown in red, while the dummy vehicles shown in blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running multiple simulations with different initial seeds, they all led to the same outcome, albeit with slight differences in the dummy cars' trajectories, but for all intents and purposes they can be considered the same. The following animation shows the outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"scene_seed_18_R_-207.569609.gif\">\n",
    "**Figure 2**: This scene has a log likelihood of -207.569609.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scene, the collision occurred at the rear of the test vehicle. Since the models only sense what is in front of them, they cannot detect and therefore avoid any rear threat.\n",
    "This scenario was used to illustrate that functions described above can be implemented on the AutomotiveDrivingModels simulator, and that the MCTS adaptive stress testing method will find cases where an event will happen in the simulator. In the following section, the environment is changed to the crosswalk environment, where more interesting cases are explored."

    "Three crosswalk scenarios have been implemented, they all consisted of a test vehicle that has the same model as the test vehicle in the highway scenario, and a pedestrian. The model of the pedestrian is what distinguished these three scenarios.\n",
    "The following figure shows the initial setup for the crosswalk scenarios:\n",

    "The car is chosen so close to the crosswalk in order to increase the likelihood of an event happening, if the car was further it is more likely that the pedestrian will cross the street before the arrival of the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random walker\n",
    "\n",
    "The first pedestrian model is a random walker that samples its longitudinal and lateral accelerations from a normal distribution:\n",
    "* $a_{lon} \\sim N(0,\\sigma)$\n",
    "* $a_{lat} \\sim N(0,\\sigma)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This resulted in an erratic behavior of the pedestrian, as the acceleration and the direction can change rapidly. The expected outcome of this scenario is that MCTS would succeed in exploiting the erratic behavior to find scenes where the pedestrian will head for the car immediately, causing a collision. The following animation shows the outcome of this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"scene_ped_rand_seed_3_R_-75.077362.gif\">\n",
    "**Figure 4**: This scene has a log likelihood of -75.077362.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which shows that the collision was due to the pedestrian jumping on the car as it approached the crosswalk, MCTS led to this outcome since it was easy to lead the random walker through a series of uneven accelerations that minimized the runtime and therefore maximized the log likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### White noise acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second pedestrian model I tried to make it more rigid and more realistic to eliminate the possibility of MCTS leading it towards easy unrealistic collisions like in the random walk model. In this model, the lateral acceleration is fixed to zero, so that the pedestrian will move only in one dimension. As for the longitudinal acceleration, it had a Gaussian model similar to the dummy cars in the highway scenario: $a_{lon} \\sim N(a_{lon},\\sigma)$. Now the state space is limited to cases where the collision happens only if the driver crosses the crosswalk while the pedestrian is there (i.e. no collisions outside or on the edge of the crosswalk, which are less likely). However, since the driver model used for the test car is a rule-based model that has perfect information, MCTS is expected to fail to find a collision, instead given the reward model used that favors situations that lead to minimum distance between the objects, it will lead to some interesting pedestrian behavior as it tries to put itself in front of the test vehicle. Several simulations were ran with different seeds, the one with the highest likelihood is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"scene_ped_seed_3_R_-282.894483.gif\">\n",
    "**Figure 5**: This scene has a log likelihood of -282.894483.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scene, MCTS tries to find the sequence of actions that will lead to the minimum distance between the pedestrian and the vehicle when the horizon of the simulation is reached. That led to the pedestrian trying to stay stationed in its initial position, which required a series of accelerations and decelerations since it starts with nonzero initial velocity, and as the end of the horizon approaches it finally decides to cross so that by the endtime it is exactly in front of the vehicle. As for the vehicle's behavior, the crosswalk (when there is a pedestrian) presents an obstacle for the vehicle, and for that the only option that is available to the vehicle is to stop at the crosswalk until it is cleared. The jittering in the vehicle's direction is caused by a bug in the simulator. To solve the issue of the rigid car model, noise can be added to its sensor reading, or another more complex and stochastic model can be used. The next scenario shows the result of the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensor noise\n",
    "\n",
    "The third crosswalk scenario is similar to the second with a slight change in the test vehicle's model. Instead of the model getting perfect information, now there is a chance that the fore vehicle indicator will give false negatives, this was done by modifying the *track_longitudinal* function in the *IntelligentDriverModel*. Now there is a possibility that the test vehicle will cross the crosswalk while the pedestrian is crossing, and therefore cause a collision where the test vehicle is at fault. After running multiple simulations with different seeds, some of them retuned similar behavior as the second scenario, but now there are scenarios where there is a collision with the test vehicle being at fault. The following animation shows such scene:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"scene_ped_noise1_seed_4_R_-33.101541.gif\">\n",
    "**Figure 6**: This scene has a log likelihood of -33.101541.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scene shows a sequence of actions that led to the pedestrian crossing the road while the vehicle's sensors were giving false negatives about the presence of an obstacle. While it may look trivial, but this scene raises an important issue on how a vehicle should deal with noisy sensor measurements, espacially false negatives as they are harder to deal with."

    "## 5. Comments\n",
    "In the presented scenarios, the adaptive stress testing method managed to drive the simulator either to a collision or to a state where the distance between the vehicles is minimized. The rule-based model with perfect information is shown to be robust against all of AST's attempts to drive it to failure. This is hardly surprising given that it is a deterministic system, while the stochasticity resided in the environment around it. However, as soon as stochasticity was added to it in the form of false negatives in one of the sensors' readings, the AST managed to find situations where this sensor malfunction would lead to a collision. I believe that given the current state of the simulator and the models it has, this was the best that can be exploited and tested under AST. Any more situations and scenarios to be tested mean that the simulator must first:\n",
    "* Upgrade the IntelligentDriverModel to better deal with crosswalks.\n",
    "* Upgrade the lane changing model, since it detected that there are no other lanes to switch to even though there is a left lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further improvements can go beyond rule-based model to incorporate data driven models, such as the GAIL driver model developed in [2], or adapting the pedestrian social behaviors developed in [3,4] to the crosswalk environment."
